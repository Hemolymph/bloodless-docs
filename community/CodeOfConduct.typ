= The Bloodless Code Of Conduct
The goal in Bloodless' community spaces, as well as any space moderated and owned by Katie Ampersand, is to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of characteristics like level of experience, disabilities, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, among others.

This document sets an overall tone for our community. It is not a rulebook defining a rigurous system by which a behavior can be classified as allowed or not allowed; instead, it is meant to be followed in spirit. Just because something isn't explicitly mentioned here, does not mean you are free to do it.

This code of conduct applies to all members of the community, including people in charge of managing its spaces.

== Rules
+ Treat everone with respect. Harassment, attempts to harm others and any form of hate speech are not tolerated.
+ Spam or unsolicited self promotion is not allowed without permission from a staff member. Self-promotion that applies to the conversation at hand is generally okay.
+ No age-restricted content. This includes text, images, or links to external sites, and things like sexual, violent and otherwise disturbing concent.
+ If an argument has low chance of resolution, take it elsewhere or drop it completely. Even if the goal is to muse about these disagreements in a friendly manner, it may be best to take it to its own space.
+ Do not bring up topics that you know will make moderation difficult or are overly polarizing.
+ Try to respect people's boundaries.
+ Bloodless explicitly welcomes and attempts to provide a safe space for LGBTQIA+ people, neurodivergent people and plural systems.
+ Bloodless explicitly does _not_ welcome people who subscribe to fascism, colonialism, racism, homophobia, conspiracy theories, among other ideologies and opinions.
+ Don't be an asshole.
