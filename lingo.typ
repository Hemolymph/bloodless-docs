= Bloodless Lingo
This document is a reference for the syntax that one should use when writing the abilities of a Bloodless card. It is not a rigorous grammar, but closer to a style guide.

== Numbers
Numbers greater than two must be written as digits.

Numbers lower than two may be written as digits or as English words. In the context of the word "gain" (gaining blood, increasing a counter, increasing a stat), it is preferred to use digits for all numbers.

== Shorthands
When desperate for space, it is possible to use shorthands for triggers. *Whenever this card is killed* can be written as *when killed*.

== Stats
Stats may be written as X/Y/Z, where X, Y and Z are health, defense and power respectively.

Stat increases and decreases may be written as  `+X/Y/Z` and `-X/Y/Z`. Individual stat changes may also have the sign, such as `gain +1 power`

== Passive Mods
An ability that says that a creature `has +1 power` is different from one that says `gains +1 power`, as the former passively affects the stat, whereas the latter is a permanent stat change.

Similarly, "becomes" is a permanent change, but "is" is a passive change.
