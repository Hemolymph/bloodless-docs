# Bloodless Docs
This repository contains mostly rules documents, and is used to keep track of the development of Bloodless.

The `rules` folder contains both the comprehensive rules and the basic rules overview.

The `unstable` folder contains descriptions and possible definitions of features that will make it into the game once their behavior is properly defined. Cards may be designed with use of these features in order to determine the behavior of the currently specified implementation and how it contrasts with the desired behavior.

The `definitions` folder is used to keep track of lists of meanings that are not yet defined anywhere else, but should be. Ideally, each document in this folder will specify the reason why they are not documented in a more official place (like the comprehensive rules, or their own document, if the list needs to be accessible to the average player).

The `community` folder contains rules regarding human interactions in Bloodless spaces.
