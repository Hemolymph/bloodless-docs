= Card Faces
The current existance of the Flip ability demands the possibility of cards that internally have two faces. The current model of what a Card is is not capable of supporting this idea.

== Technical Implementation
+ Card Faces
  + A card face has: Name (optionally), Type, and Cost (a number which may be a variable).
  + A card face may have a Flip Cost (a number which may be a variable).
